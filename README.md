# Fi: Liepiest Galaxy
Fi: An Abstract Game is an alternate-history online text roleplaying game, created by @sglushki.

The first and second iterations of Fi were dead-ends, due to a lack of player input and clear direction for the story.

The third iteration of Fi began on August 31st, 2023 at 8:00 PM Pacific Standard Time. This iteration takes place in the Liepiest Galaxy, where a group of interstellar alien civilizations would fight over the last galaxy in the universe.

Fi was officially included in the broader Mix Up canon right before the launch of the third iteration. All Characters, Nations, Events, and Worlds in Fi are Mix Up canon.
